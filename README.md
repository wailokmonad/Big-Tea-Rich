Self-made NodeJS Framework

This is a self-made NodeJS web framework. It is always said that the best way to understand something is to build one. So, i decided to learn it by creating one on my own.

As everyone can see, these are just a few JS files using all build-in modules in Node. You don't have to install any third party libraries for it to work. Its style is heavily based on Express. It let user define the route, and a basic template-engine to render the html content. It parses incoming querystring or body data for user. It also supports middleware. That's it! I believe this is pretty much what we care most in web development. That's it :) :) :)

By default, i've set up few routes in app.js. If you start the server and head over to http://localhost:3000/, then you will see "Hello World !!", which is the content of index.html in the "View" folder.

The code is simple. Please feel free to play around with it.

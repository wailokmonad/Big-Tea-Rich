Self-made NodeJS Framework

This is a self-made NodeJS web framework. The motivation stems from my constant frustration on having to work with something you don't really know how it comes to be. So, i decided to learn it by creating one on my own.

As everyone can see, its logic merely contains three JS files, with simple, even poor, javascipt using all build-in modules in Node. If you have some experience in web development, especially with Express.JS, i'm pretty sure you can understand it.

The framework contains a basic web server that let user define the route, and a basic template-engine to render the html content. It parses incoming querystring or body data for user. It also supports middleware. That's it! I believe this is pretty much what we care most in web development. That's it :) :) :)

Needless to say, it might be lanugable to say that it is a "framework". But the idea is not to use it in production. The main goal is to draw some understanding on how a web framework is built, how to think in terms of a framework author. Lastly, this is not to say that i have sucessfully mastered everything and i should send my CV to Google in no time. Just as babies always stand before they can even totter, i believe this is an unavoidable step to achieve complete mastery over web development!!!
